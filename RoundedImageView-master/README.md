A fast ImageView (and Drawable) that supports rounded corners (and ovals or circles) based on the original [example from Romain Guy](http://www.curious-creature.org/2012/12/11/android-recipe-1-image-with-rounded-corners/). RoundedImageView is a full superset of [CircleImageView](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) (which is actually just a subset based on this lib) with many more advanced features like support for ovals, rounded rectangles, ScaleTypes and TileModes.

There are many ways to create rounded corners in android, but this is the fastest and best one that I know of because it:
* does **not** create a copy of the original bitmap
* does **not** use a clipPath which is not hardware accelerated and not anti-aliased.
* does **not** use setXfermode to clip the bitmap and draw twice to the canvas.

If you know of a better method, let me know (or even better open a pull request)!

Also has proper support for:
* Borders (with Colors and ColorStateLists)
* Ovals and Circles
* All `ScaleType`s
  * Borders are drawn at view edge, not bitmap edge
  * Except on edges where the bitmap is smaller than the view
  * Borders are **not** scaled up/down with the image (correct width and radius are maintained)
* Anti-aliasing
* Transparent backgrounds
* Hardware acceleration
* Support for LayerDrawables (including TransitionDrawables)
* TileModes for repeating drawables


Gradle
----
RoundedImageView is available in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.makeramen%22%20AND%20a%3A%22roundedimageview%22).

Add the following to your `build.gradle` to use:
```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.makeramen:roundedimageview:2.2.1'
}
```


Usage
----
Define in xml:

```xml
<com.makeramen.roundedimageview.RoundedImageView
        xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
        android:id="@+id/imageView1"
        android:src="@drawable/photo1"
        android:scaleType="fitCenter"
        app:riv_corner_radius="30dip"
        app:riv_border_width="2dip"
        app:riv_border_color="#333333"
        app:riv_mutate_background="true"
        app:riv_tile_mode="repeat"
        app:riv_oval="true" />
```

Or in code:

```java
RoundedImageView riv = new RoundedImageView(context);
riv.setScaleType(ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);
riv.setCornerRadius((float) 10);
riv.setBorderWidth((float) 2);
riv.setBorderColor(Color.DKGRAY);
riv.mutateBackground(true);
riv.setImageDrawable(drawable);
riv.setBackground(backgroundDrawable);
riv.setOval(true);
riv.setTileModeX(Shader.TileMode.REPEAT);
riv.setTileModeY(Shader.TileMode.REPEAT);
```

Or make a Transformation for Picasso:

```java
Transformation transformation = new RoundedTransformationBuilder()
          .borderColor(Color.BLACK)
          .borderWidthDp(3)
          .cornerRadiusDp(30)
          .oval(false)
          .build();

Picasso.with(context)
    .load(url)
    .fit()
    .transform(transformation)
    .into(imageView);
```
